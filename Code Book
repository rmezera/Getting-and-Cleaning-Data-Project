# This is the codebook that describes the data fields that are on the final datasets after running the R code in run_analysis.R file.


# Format of the final dataset
expdata       - this is the placeholder for which record this represents
subjects      - This is a number that indicates which subject the readings were taken from.  They range from 1-30
activity      - This is the activity that the readings refer to. There are 6: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying
bodyAccXMean  - Data indicating the average bodyAccX measurement
bodyAccXStdv  - Data indicating the standard deviation of bodyAccX measurement
bodyAccYMean  - Data indicating the average bodyAccY measurement
